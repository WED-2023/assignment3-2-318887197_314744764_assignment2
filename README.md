how to use api key - https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs#Authentication

what we changed:
- changed User post req to Register path
- added Login, Logout req
- added (get,post,delete) favorites to api
- added sql tables

to discuss:

decisions:
- template -> api
- local recipes will have an id that may conflic with spoonacular ids so 
the tables will have a referance of the source of the recipe and the server will
broadcast id's as L(id) for locally saved recipes and S(id) for spoonacular recipes
keeping thee uniqueness of the ids
- all incoming messages will be in the body


TODO:
- hash or smt the api key as it is not safe to save it in plaintext
- check what to do with the errors
- fix comments
- check that all the incoming messages are read and required in the body
- fix bugs


Done: 
- Register user
- Login
- Logout
- Get full recipe from spoon and local db
- Created dbs 
- added watched, favorites and likes? no way to check 
- sorted by newest â†‘
- added get 3 random recipes

recipe format:
    recipe = {
        id: "L" + recipe.id,
        title: recipe.title,
        readyInMinutes: recipe.readyInMinutes,
        servings: recipe.servings,
        glutenFree: recipe.glutenFree,

        family_creator: recipe.family_creator,
